WEBD-225 Hello-World Assignment

Hello! My name is Sarah Swanson and I'm currently pursuing an A.S. in Web Design & Development. I've been a business analyst for almost 4 years now and am looking to make a career switch. I live in Minnesota with my husband and our two rabbits and two frogs. I look forward to learning alongside everyone over the next seven weeks!
